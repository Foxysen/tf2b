VTFCmd but beaten up into TF2B Linux needs, WIP

Uses Linux version of VTFLib which lacks features useful for 3D model textures. Thus it's intended for GUI only.

To use it, run VTFCmd in a shell along with a .png (TODO: check others) file as an argument. This should produce .vtf file in same folder.


Installation:

As Linux Mint user, you will have to install few libraries to make it work. It works better with all the LGPL components.

First, install DevIL library:
sudo apt-get install libdevil1c2

If you plan to modify the source code of this VTFCmd, install dev version too:
sudo apt-get install libdevil-dev

Next we will manually install Linux version of VTFLib from github.com/panzi/VTFLib:

First, we need to install txc_dxtn library. It's external library that can compress DX1/DX5 formats. That wasn't part of Mesa due to patent strike fear.
Script:
sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev
# get source files
cd ~/
wget https://people.freedesktop.org/~cbrill/libtxc_dxtn/libtxc_dxtn-1.0.1.tar.gz
tar xvfz libtxc_dxtn-1.0.1.tar.gz
cd libtxc_dxtn-1.0.1
# start the job
./configure
make
sudo make install
# clean up sources (optional)
cd ..
rm -rf libtxc_dxtn-1.0.1 libtxc_dxtn-1.0.1.tar.gz

Finally, VTFLib Linux itself:
# go into any temp folder
git clone https://github.com/panzi/VTFLib.git
mkdir VTFLib/build
cd VTFLib/build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
make -j`nproc`
sudo make install
# then feel free to delete the folder
